## About us
eSolidar.com is an online charitable giving marketplace that provides different funding tools for causes and social projects. Charities and individual causes can register and raise funds (donations, charity auctions, crowdfunding, and online shopping) while also raising awareness. Anyone can register, explore and contribute to campaigns/causes.

A company can also manage its social responsibility together with its employees and community (partners, clients, etc) at business.eSolidar.com. This is a SaaS platform that allows businesses to increase their social impact, talent retention and visibility through charitable giftcards for employees/clients, corporate volunteering and impact analysis.
